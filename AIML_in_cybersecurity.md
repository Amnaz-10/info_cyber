# Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
## Core concepts

### Rule of AIML in Cybersecurity
- Machine learning for intrusion detection and malware analysis
- Predictive analytics for attack prevention
- AI driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

### AI Techniques in cybersecurity
- Supervised learning: Malware classification (Benign & Malicious)
- Unsupervised learning: Anomaly detection in logs
- Reinforcement learning: Adaptive response systems
   
### Applications of AI in Threat Detection
- Email phishing detection using NLP 
- Behavior-based endpoint protection
- Network traffic anomaly detection (IDS/IPS enhancement)
- User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

### AI-Powered tools & platforms 
- IBM QRadar Advisor With Waston 
- Darktrace (AI for network anomaly detection)
- Crowdstrike Falcon (AI endpoint protection)
- clylancePROTECT , Azure sentinel (ML based-alerts)

### Limitations & Ethical challanges 
- Adversarial ML (poisoning data, evasion attacks)
- Privacy concerns (training data exposure)
- Explainability issues (AI decision transperency)
